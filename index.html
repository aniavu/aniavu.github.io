Born in Poland, <em>Ania Vu</em> (née Vu Dang Minh Anh) is currently a PhD candidate in composition as a Benjamin Franklin Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. Her current mentors include James Primosch and Anna Weesner, and her past teachers include Robert Morris, Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon, Oliver Schneller, Carlos Sanchez-Gutierrez, and David Liptak. She completed her BM in 2017 with distinction, double-majoring in composition and theory from the Eastman School of Music and minoring in social psychology from the University of Rochester. 
</p><p>
Both finalist and recipient of an Honorable Mention from the ASCAP Morton Gould Competition Young Composers Awards, Ania’s music has been performed in the United States, Vietnam, Poland, and South Africa. At Eastman, she received the Belle Gitleman (2016),  Bernard Rodgers (2015), and Louis Lane (2014) Awards for her compositions. Her works have been performed by members of the International Contemporary Ensemble (2018) and featured at the Festival Women in Music in Rochester (2016). Her music was also read by Daedalus Quartet, Curtis Symphony Orchestra, Eastman Philharmonia, Eastman School Symphony Orchestra, and Eastman Wind Ensemble.
</p><p>
Besides composing, Ania is also an active piano performer, placing emphasis on performance equal to composition. She currently studies with prof. Amy Yang from Curtis, and studied in the past with prof. Vincent Lenti and Irina Rumiancewa-Dabrowski. She performs solo and chamber music, classical and contemporary repertoire, works of her own and of her composition peers. As pianist, she won several awards in national and international competitions in Europe, and has performed in the United States, Hungary, Spain, Italy, Poland, and Vietnam. In 2015, she participated in “Music Inspire Africa”, a program where selected musicians traveled to Zimbabwe and South Africa to expose local students to classical music through performance and teaching. 
</p>
<p>
Outside of music, Ania has a passion for languages, speaking fluently in English, French, Polish, and Vietnamese, and having studied Latin and German. She also enjoys traveling (has visited 27 countries so far), wandering in all kinds of museums, and ballroom dancing.
