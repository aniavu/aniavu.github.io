<h6>Program Notes</h6>
<p style="text-align:justify">

<em> Dark Whims </em> is structured based on the contrast between the harsh vertical dyads of minor seconds and the thin and mischievous horizontal lines. The two fight against each other and develop in unexpected ways. The dyads gradually soften in character and morph into a lyrical line... However, nothing ever becomes truly settled, and the brief pause of contemplation quickly becomes interrupted by short, mysterious figures. The piece goes back and forth between the two characters, but also sometimes has them on top of each other: by the end, the horizontal line becomes a relentless, growing ostinato and eventually becomes its opposite force.
Because the piano is a percussive instrument, I explored the extent of control the pianist has over connecting notes through resonance to form phrases. More importantly,“Dark Whims” is a study of how different resonances (related to the attack, sustainment in
length and dynamics) can create different character.
