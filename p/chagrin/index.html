<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
<em> Paroles du Chagrin </em> features poems by Paul Verlaine (1844-1946) and Jacques
Prévert (1900-1977) that to me, all share feelings of sorrow - hence, the title of the
cycle (Songs of Sorrow). <br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
The opening song is a depiction of a seemingly defiant femme fatale whose
caprice and provocativeness only serve to mask her vulnerability. That evanescent
moment of exposed weakness in the middle of the song is rare, yet crucial to
understanding her otherwise confident image that she is trying to project.<br>
More desolate and suspenseful, “Déjeuner du matin” is also narrated from a
female perspective. She is observing her lover, describing his every move, while he is
coldly performing his daily routine without acknowledging her presence. When he
suddenly stands up and leaves, perhaps forever, she breaks down. The outburst of
sixteenth notes in a six-note ostinato at the end in the piano represents the pouring
rain under which the man disappears, and also the rush of anger and fear that the
woman experiences. <br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Verlaine compares tears to rain in "Il pleure dans mon coeur". These light yet
consistent and piercing staccati notes on the piano become dried out tears by the end (muted strings of the piano), until they also gradually evaporate. The central point of this poem is the hopeless question to why is there so much pain... without reason? Perhaps it is the lack of answer that makes this poem the most disheartened. <br>
<span style="margin-left: 40px;">
Finally, the cycle closes on a more lighthearted note with "Le ciel est par-dessus
le toit", yet it only appears so. Verlaine wrote this poem when he was in prison. As the
poem unfolds, there are hints of bitterness that lead to the final stanza where the
speaker explicitly expresses remorse for his lost youth. To portray the idea of life being
elusive, I set the text with music that imitates a somewhat fast-moving waltz.
